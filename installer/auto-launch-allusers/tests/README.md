This is where the tests live. The same tests are ran no matter which platform you're on, but the executable is different. We've one per platform in the [executables](executables/) directory (except a system one is used for Mac).

Our tests could be improved.

- They don't test anything.
- We don't check or enforce code coverage.
- We don't use a mocking / spec framework like [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/).
